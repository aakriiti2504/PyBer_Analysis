# PyBer_Analysis


## Overview:

As a data analyst for PyBer, a python based ride sharing app company. The first assignment is to perform an exportory analysis on data in some CSV files. To aid the process, several types of visualizations to tell a compelling story about the data.

## Background:

It's my second week as a data analyst at PyBer, a ride-sharing app company valued at $2.3 billion. I have just been assigned my first big project: analyze all the rideshare data from January to earlyMay of 2019 and create a compelling visualization for the CEO, V. Isualize. Even before starting at PyBer,I had heard stories about V. Isualize. She is a former programmer who started out at MathWorks, a co-founder of PyBer, and is known for being extremely fair yet extremely demanding. Because of her programming expertise, she's particularly insistent that the analytical work be comprehensive and correct. This assignment is both a once-in-a-lifetime challenge and a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. My aim is to work on this project and bring out taccurate results.My manager, Omar, is excited for my big break and has agreed to partner with me on getting the visualizations just right. As a new employee, this is a huge professional opportunity for me.



## Tools Used:

We will use Python scripts using Panda's libraries,Jupyter Notebook and MAtplotlib to create a variety of charts to showcase the relationship between the type of city and number of drivers and riders as well as the percentage of total fares, riders and drivers by type of city. Python graphing library Matplotlib is a favorite tool among data scientists and data analysts because of its robust visualization features. Matplotlib is a graphing and plotting library for Python that comes with the Anaconda installation. To use it with Jupyter Notebook, all we need to do is import it. Matplotlib is often used with another Python library, NumPy, a numerical mathematics library for making arrays or matrices.

Omar has given me some backstory about the connection between V. Isualize and Matplotlib. Matplotlib was created as a Python
alternative for MATLAB. MATLAB, which is short for matrix laboratory, was developed by the company MathWorks in the 1980s. 
It enabled scientists to perform linear algebra and numerical analysis without learning the programming language Fortran, which 
until then had been the best option for complex computations.


## Matlplotlib:

Matplotlib also has rich styling options. One can customize annotations for chart axes, titles and legends, the color and size of lines, bars, and bubbles, and the chart's background. It also lets you save and print publication-quality charts.Because of these features, Matlplotlib is one of the most popular plotting libraries for Python. Matplotlib has two methods for graphing data. One uses MATLAB's plotting syntax and functionality and the other uses an object-oriented interface. MATLAB's plotting syntax is concise and the most useful when creating simple plots that require little coding. This method is most effective when graphing data directly from a DataFrame. The object-oriented method is better suited to more complicated graphs that require more coding, such as those with multiple lines or bars, or multiple plots in one graph. Here, we'll use Matplotlib's plotting methods in the Jupyter Notebook environment with data from the ride-sharing dataset. 


## Purpose:

The amount of analysis and visualizations produced will help PyBer improve access to ridesharing services and determine affordability for under served neighborhoods.



## Procedure:

 - 1) A github reposirtory PyBer_Analysis is created so that I can share project details with Omar and other colleagues.
 - 2) Checked the version of Matlplotlib library 
 - 3) Omar has suggested that I start with one of the most common charts: a line chart. I will also be commenting on my code. This way, if he or the CEO wants to take a look at    your repo, they'll know exactly whatI am  doing and whether you're heading in the right direction.
